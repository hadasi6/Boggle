# Boggle (Python)

A desktop word game with a GUI. 
This project is a classic Boggle game where players find words on a 4x4 letter board within a time limit. 
It features a graphical user interface built with Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library, following the MVC pattern (game logic separated from UI). 
The game includes a start menu, interactive play (with word validation and scoring), and an end-of-game summary.

## Project Architecture

The Boggle game is structured following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:
- **Model**: Manages game logic and data.
- **View**: Handles the graphical user interface.
- **Controller**: Manages the game flow and user interactions.

## How to run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (Tkinter is included in standard Python installations).
2. Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory.
3. Run the game by executing the main script: python3 src/main.py. A window will open with the Boggle board so you can start playing immediately.
