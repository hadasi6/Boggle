# Boggle

## Goal

Create a Boggle game where players find words from adjacent letters on a 4x4 board, featuring a GUI, game logic model, and controller.

## Project Architecture

The Boggle game is structured following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:
- **Model**: Manages game logic and data.
- **View**: Handles the graphical user interface.
- **Controller**: Manages the game flow and user interactions.

## Flow

1. **Start**: Initiates the game and displays the start screen.
2. **Play**: User forms words, validated by the model, updating the score.
3. **End**: Timer runs out, final score displayed, option to restart or exit.
